_Abstract_ - This project presents a warehouse simulation developed using NetLogo to model agent-based behaviors and operational dynamics in a real-world warehouse environment. The simulation was informed by a site visit to the ICT warehouse, allowing the team to capture accurate layout data and process flows. Key features include the integration of interactive elements such as sliders, monitors, and plots to enhance user engagement and tracking of agent activities. The simulation models various entities, including workers and forklifts, navigating the warehouse with realistic movement patterns. Effective teamwork was central to the project's success, with clearly delegated roles in coding, data collection, simulation testing, and documentation. The outcome is a functional, visually supported simulation tool that can assist in understanding and optimizing warehouse operations.
